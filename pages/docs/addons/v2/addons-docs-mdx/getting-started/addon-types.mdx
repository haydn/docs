## Addon Types

Addons can be used in a wide variety of use cases. To help you meet the differing needs your customers, we allow you to create three different types of Addon.

Let's take a look at the different types available along with some ideas of when it would be appropriate to use them:

### Standalone

Standalone Addons live inside of zeit.co and are provided both with access to the ZEIT API and the ability to create custom user interfaces.

#### Use Cases:

- An Addon that creates a database and adds the connection string to a ZEIT projects
- Error tracking and performance monitoring by exposing environment variables
- Finding and listing the top contributors inside a ZEIT team
- Providing email support for your domain

### OAuth

OAuth Addons are best used for authentication and the verification of customer identities.

#### Use Cases:

- Allowing users to login with their ZEIT credentials
- Adding a ZEIT integration inside your application

### Hybrid

Hybrid Addons are a combination of Standalone and OAuth that provide great power and flexibility to the developer.

#### Use Cases:

- A BitBucket integration, storing **OAuth** tokens with a **Standalone** Addon for selecting repositories
- Requiring a user's AWS data and ZEIT API access
