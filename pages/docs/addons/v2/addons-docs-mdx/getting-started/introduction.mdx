## Introduction

Our main goal at ZEIT is to make it simple for developers to build apps and deploy them quickly. With this goal in mind, we provide a variety of products such as [Now](/now), [Domains](/domains) and the [GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/)/[GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) integrations to empower them to do so.

Our customers want integrations with different databases, third party services and UI/UX needs. In our pursuit to make the lives of developers easier we've looked at several options and believe ZEIT Addons are the perfect way to do this.

### ZEIT Addons

With **ZEIT Addons**, we introduce a way to extend the capabilities of ZEIT and to integrate with virtually any platform available. Here's just some the things you can do with **ZEIT addons**:

- Add databases into deployments with just a few clicks.
- Add custom UI elements in <https://zeit.co>
- Enable complete access to our [API](/docs/api)
- Easily configure third party services such as error tracking and performance monitoring.
- Create mashup apps integrating multiple different services of your choosing
- Add Login with ZEIT for your app
- Access hardware and connect with external devices such Arduino, Philips Hue, etc.

These are just a few of the possibilities afforded by ZEIT Addons, in reality, there is not limit to what you can create.

### What's an Addon

Before we start building our first Addon, let's find out what an Addon is:

- It's a HTTP endpoint meaning you can write it with any language you like
- You can run it locally or deploy anywhere
- The HTTP endpoint receives a [ZEIT API](/docs/api) token among other information. (For the installed user or team)
- Using our API, you can add project level environment variables and store some metadata related to the installation
- You can return `JSX` as the HTTP response to build UI elements
- You can interact with users via buttons and different input elements
- It can also work as a standard OAuth2 app

### What's a UiHook

A **UiHook** is the name we use for the HTTP endpoint of an Addon. We use the name **UiHook** because it's similar to a Webhook, but based on user interfaces.

- It's another name for a Wehbook
- It's the name given for the HTTP endpoint of the ZEIT Addon
- It's another name for a ZEIT Addon
- It's the name given for the installation of a ZEIT Addon

### How to Use an Addon

- Once you create the Addon, you will get a public URL for it such as <https://zeit.co/addon/my-addon>
- Any ZEIT user can visit that URL and install it on a user or team account
- Once installed, the Addon gets a set of pages inside <https://zeit.co>
- When the user accesses the installation page we call the Addon's UiHook
- UiHooks are only active while the user is viewing the installation (through a short lived token)
- Addons can use the OAuth authorization flow to get a long lived token as well

Let's build our first ZEIT Addon.
