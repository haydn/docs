## Introduction

ZEIT Addons give you the ability to extend the capabilities of ZEIT, making it easier for your customers to access your product in a setting they are already familiar with.

By taking advantage of Addons you will be able to perform actions on behalf of users and provide integrations that bring your product together with the ZEIT platform in many different ways.

This documentation outlines the types of Addon you can create, recommended workflows and how to use the [ZEIT Component System](#component-system) for rapid development and seamless integration with the platform.
