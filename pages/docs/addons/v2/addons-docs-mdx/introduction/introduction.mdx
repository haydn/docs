## Introduction

Our main goal at ZEIT is to make it simple for developers to build apps and deploy them quickly. With this goal in mind, we provide a variety of products such as [Now](/now), [Domains](/domains) and the [GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/)/[GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) integrations to empower them to do so.

Our customers want integrations with different databases, third party services and UI/UX needs. In our pursuit to make the lives of developers easier we've looked at several options and believe ZEIT Addons are the perfect way to do this.
